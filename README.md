# simpleEntry
Created a Python script to automate the data entry formatting part of my current job. Subsequently converted it to Java to run it natively on the virtual machine and improve performance as I used to run the Python script through an online IDE.

At my current job we were instructed to rename files and save them in a specific format with the people in charge specifying that you should type it out every single time and if you really wanted to you could use notepad to have a template ready. When I heard this a lightbulb went off in my head and I got straight to cooking.

Although it is something very simple it has improved the following:
1) Reduced error rate.
2) Improved performance.
3) Lessened mental burden.

With this plus using other methods such as hotkeys, pastebinp and separate Excel sheets I'm able to exceed the daily target in about 2.5 hours in comparission to the average grind of 7.5 hours and place myself in the above average category when compared to my colleagues.
